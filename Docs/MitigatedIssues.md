### X-Frame-Options Header Not Set 
- Risk: Medium
- Confidence: Medium
- Fix: Update to Startup.cs Configure method in app.Use()

### X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

### Cookie Without Secure Flag
- Fix: Added using statement for Microsoft.AspNetCore.CookiePolicy to Startup.cs and added a cookie policy to Configure method in app.UseCookiePolicy()

### Loosely Scoped Cookie 
- Risk: Informational
- Confidence: Low
- Fix: Update to Startup.cs Configure method by setting CookieOptions for new CookieOptions to include Domain and Path settings (this only works on the live site, not on localhost and was tested by Tiff, as I was unable to bring myself to destroy my Azure site or get charged for creating a new "deployment test" site since I only have $8 in Azure credits remaining).
