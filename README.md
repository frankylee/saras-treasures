# S.A.R.A.'s Teasures
ASP.NET full website redesign for [local non-profit](https://sarastreasures.org) in Eugene, OR.

## Lab 1: Validation of User Input
For all three types of web sites, add validation using data annotations to your models. Use validation that makes sense for the properties you choose to validate.

Create a new branch named Lab1 based on your main branch.
- Add validation to at least three properties from any of your models.
- Use at least three different validation attributes.
- At least one property should have more than one validation attribute.

To make the validation useful, in addition to adding validation annotations to model properties you will also need to:
- Add a new migration and update your database
- Add at least a validation summary tag helper to the views where data entry is done.
- Add code to check ModelState in the controller methods that the data entry forms post to.
